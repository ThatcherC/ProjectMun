TODO:
- [ ] Figure out if epsilon2 is in a righthanded frame
    * run two simulations, one on each side of the impact region
    * observe calculated and actual eps2
- [ ] Calculate exit angle from Mun
    * add/subtract entry angle and deflection angle depending on eps2 sign
    * depends on handedness of eps2
- [ ] Calculate exit speed and angle in Kerbin frame

- [ ] refactor the git repo

- [ ] Relook at autopilots
- [ ] Provide good documentation for the autopilots
- [ ] Choose the best orbit selection method for the autopilot - maybe give initial phase angle, like in an early version? maybe that version still exists

- [ ] explore orbits
    * conventional free return
    * slingshot - identify by kerbin speed and angle after intercept
    * that free return orbit that goes way out and then infront of the moon
      * play with KSP antenna mechanics
