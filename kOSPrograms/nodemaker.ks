//ShipPos and MunPos are the vector positions of the ship and the Mun
//relative to Kerbin
lock ShipPos to -Kerbin:position.

//This gets the current angle between the ship and the Mun
set phase to arctan2(ShipPos:x,ShipPos:z)-arctan2(MunPos:x,MunPos:z).

//dp is difference between current and desired phase
set dp to (phase-105).

set t to dp/.1894.

print t.

set mynode to NODE(time:seconds+t,0,0,856.3).
add mynode.
