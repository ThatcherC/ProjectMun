kOS Program Outline:

Launch craft ~3 orbital periods before t_a
Program starts with an orbit

[ ] 0. Get zero inclination orbit
[ ] 1. Circularize
[ ] 2. Approach desired periapsis angle
[ ] 3. Perform burn so that craft returns to periapsis at t_a-tfl
[ ] 4. Wait until periapsis
[ ] 5. Burn so that velocity matches calculated value
