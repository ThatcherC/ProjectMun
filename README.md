# ProjectMun
Applying physics to a mission to the Mun in Kerbal Space Program. Most of the information will be on my blog, 
but all the relevant programs will be kept here.

###Integrators

It turns out there are some nasty integrals to solve if one wants to fly to the Mun, so I'll use a computer to integrate 
for me. Right now there's only one program:

* *integrator.cpp* - This program solves the differential equation that will tell the amount of time a rocket will take to travel from one heigh to another given certain orbital parameters.

###Autopilots

I will also be using kOS programs to perform all the necessary maneuvers once all the calculations are finished. 
The kOS mod allows rockets in the game to programmed, allowing much more precise control than I could manage myself.
